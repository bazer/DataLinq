# DataLinq

DataLinq is a comprehensive database interfacing library designed to simplify querying, relationship operations, caching, and parallel processing. It offers intuitive methods to streamline your database operations, whether you're performing basic CRUD actions or handling complex relationships.

## Key Features
- **Metadata Handling**: Seamlessly retrieve and manage database metadata.
- **Query Operations**: Perform SQL-like query operations such as `ToList()`, `Count()`, `Where()`, and more.
- **Relationship Management**: Effortlessly manage table relationships, supporting features like lazy loading.
- **Caching**: Enhance performance with built-in caching mechanisms.
- **Threading Support**: Execute concurrent database operations with robust parallel processing capabilities.

## Getting Started

## Core Features

```csharp
// Example: Querying the 'Departments' table
var departments = employeesDb.Query().Departments.ToList();

// Example: Using SQL-like operations
var specificDept = employeesDb
                   .From<Department>()
                   .Where("dept_no").EqualTo("d005")
                   .Select();



## Relationship Operations

Handling relationships between tables is straightforward with DataLinq:

```csharp
// Lazy load a single value
var manager = employeesDb.Query().Managers.Single(x => x.dept_fk == "d005" && x.emp_no == 4923);
Assert.NotNull(manager.Department);

// Lazy load a list
var department = employeesDb.Query().Departments.Single(x => x.DeptNo == "d005");
Assert.NotEmpty(department.Managers);
```

## Advanced Features

### Caching
DataLinq's caching capabilities ensure faster data retrieval after the initial fetch. The library intelligently manages cache to optimize performance.

### Parallel Processing
With built-in threading support, DataLinq allows for concurrent database operations, suitable for applications that require high concurrency.

```csharp
// Example: Parallel read operations
Parallel.For(0, 10, i => {
    var employee = employeesDb.Query().Employees.Single(x => x.emp_no == 1004 + i);
});
```

## Testing

DataLinq comes with a comprehensive set of unit tests to ensure its robustness. To run the tests, follow the steps provided in the testing documentation.
